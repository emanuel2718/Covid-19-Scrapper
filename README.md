# Covid-19-Scrapper

This started as a simple command line interface web scrapper script for COVID-19 data.
This was done as a way for me to practice Python programming language and at the same time
gather important data for me and whoever want to use this script.
All the COVID-19 data is scraped using https://virustracker.com free API.
Sources used: WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, DXY
	
For the original source of the data please visit: [World Health Organization website](https://www.who.int)
	

## Output 1 (Worldwide Data):

## Output 2:

By selecting option 2; a pager page, containing all the countries and their 
respective abbreviations, will appear on the screen. To quit just press 'q'.

## Output 3 (Country-specific Data):

## Future Implementations:

- [x] Add more data alternatives (i.e Death Rates, % of Populations, etc.)
- [x] Make it interactive (Add main menu for alternatives)
- [ ] Display changes for the day in data (i.e +- X amount of cases today)
- [ ] Make a GUI
- [ ] Make a webpage
