# Covid-19-Scrapper
	I was bored and in quarantine due to COVID-19 so I wrote a simple web scrapper
	script to get COVID-19 data from https://virustracker.com free API.
	Sources used: WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, DXY
	

## Output:

## Future Implementations:

- [x] Add more data alternatives (i.e Death Rates, % of Populations, etc.)
- [x] Make it interactive (Add main menu for alternatives)
- [ ] Make a GUI
